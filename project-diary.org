  Doing some research about the subject. 

  
** Terminology

   Prior - \(P(\theta | M)\)
   Likelihood - \(P(M, \theta | Data)\)
   
   Posterior - \(P(\theta | Data)\)
   Evidence - \(P(Model | Data)\)

   Bayes' theorem says that 

   \[Likelihood \times Prior = Posterior \times Evidence\]

   So can use this to find the parameter values of a model, + the likelihood that the model fits the data at all.
